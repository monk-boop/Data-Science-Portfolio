# Portfolio
This Portfolio contains a collection of only my best Data Science/ Machine Learning/ Deep Learning projects.
## Machine Learning:
  - [Google Customer Revenue Prediciton](https://github.com/monk-boop/Google-Customer-Revenue-Prediction): A kaggle competition where the objective is to predict the revenue returning customers will generate in a G-Store. Used time series analysis and some transformations as features to the dataset to finally make a regression model using XG Boost.
  - [Cancer Prediction](https://github.com/monk-boop/Cancer-Prediction): Multi-Class classification problem -  using text from research papers to decide the class of cancer a patient may be suffering from.
  - [Microsoft Malware Detection](https://github.com/monk-boop/Microsoft-Malware-Detection): Multi Class Classification problem - used data from ASM and BYTE files to form features and decide the type of virus a file may contain. The size of the dataset was almost 500GB.
  
## Deep Learning :
  - [CANet on the Indian Driving Dataset](https://github.com/monk-boop/CANet-on-Indian-Driving-Dataset): Built the Attention Guided Context Aggregation Network for semantic segmentation on the Indian Driving Dataset.
  - [Toxic Comment Classification](https://github.com/monk-boop/Toxic-comment-Classification): Another Kaggle Competition where the objective is to analyse online comments and classify them based on their profanity.
