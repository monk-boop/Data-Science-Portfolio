# Portfolio
This Portfolio contains a collection of only my best Data Science/ Machine Learning/ Deep Learning projects.
## Machine Learning:
  - ###[Google Customer Revenue Prediciton](https://github.com/monk-boop/Google-Customer-Revenue-Prediction): A kaggle competition where the objective is to predict the revenue returning customers will generate in a G-Store. Used time series analysis and some transformations as features to the dataset to finally make a regression model using XG Boost.
